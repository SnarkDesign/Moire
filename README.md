#Moire Program

![](/img/20230115_164808.jpg)

C code to draw a Moire program for any given size screen.

Writen from scratch. 

Code is adapted for BW version of the Heltec esp32 wifi kit OLED. 
Color version adapted to the ttgo Lily LED. Color routine adapted from their example codes.


Based on the old Applesoft Moire program that came with the Apple ][ diskette.
Yes, you could also know it from the ScreenSaver programs of old times and it was also a motivation to do this program as Arduino LED screen components might also suffer from burned in pixels always displaying  the same screen when unused... 

Since i didn't have the old Apply ][ diskette or managed to find the code on the net, I decided to write it from scratch. 

Lots of variations can be added to this code but I like this one for its simplicity and the many different patterns - pseudo fractal /diffusion/grating progression and like the game of life patterns appear.

Feel free to augment the script... Changing colors, deltas values and delta logic also can be changed. And adding different shapes would be nice.
